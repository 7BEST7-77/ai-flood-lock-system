# AI Decision Logic (Theory)

## Predictive AI
- Trained on past rainfall and flood patterns
- Forecasts potential flood zones

## Functional AI
- Gets real-time data
- Compares predicted risk vs actual water level
- Makes decisions: open, close, hold flaps

## Redundancy
If predictive AI fails, functional AI still acts based on live data.
