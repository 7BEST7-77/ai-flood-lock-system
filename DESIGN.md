# Design and Diagrams

The system includes:
- Modular flaps along water channels
- Sensors (water level, pressure, rainfall)
- Microcontroller with AI chip
- Solar-powered units
- Central station and satellite uplink (optional)

## Basic Flow
1. Sensors detect risk
2. AI evaluates risk level
3. Flaps open/close to control flow
4. Devices communicate with nearby units
